# CorgiMVC

## What is it?
CorgiMVC is featured just like the dog it's named after, lightweight, small, but with tons of personality. We built this framework because there was no other MVC framework that was this small, (only one file makes up the framework) does classes and namespaces correctly, has ORM built in, and has support for both MySQL and SQLite.

## What's its purpose?
CorgiMVC is great for applications that need a small footprint. We use it for the GUIs for our server scripts and desktop applications.

## Features
- MVC
- OOP/Class/Namespaces Enabled
- ORM Enabled (Thanks to https://github.com/arkphp/database)
- No RewriteEngine required for friendly URLs
- Only need composer to install initially on a dev machine
